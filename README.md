## Hey, I’m Simon — your friendly neighborhood fullstack developer 🧑‍💻

I enjoy turning ideas into working software, usually with C# and .NET or whatever suits the project best. Creating tools that are useful, practical, and grounded in real-world needs is where my focus tends to land 🧰.

Software development has been my main pursuit since 2022, growth driven by hands-on projects, mentorship, and a continuous cycle of learning and refining 🔁. Experience in system administration has also shaped how I think about deployment, infrastructure, and the environments where code actually runs.

What keeps me motivated is seeing a rough idea evolve into something functional and real 🚀. It's not always smooth, but the process is deeply rewarding.

Always learning. Always building 🔧
